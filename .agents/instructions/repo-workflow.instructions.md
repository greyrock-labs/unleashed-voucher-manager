# Repo workflow

## Commits and pushes

- Commit straight to `main` as linear commits; no feature branches or pull
  requests unless asked.
- One focused commit per concern, Conventional Commits style:
  `fix(backend): ...`, `feat(frontend): ...`, `docs: ...`, `ci: ...`. Use two
  commits when a change has two kinds of content, for example code and an
  unrelated doc fix.
- Push without asking when the change is low-risk (docs, agent instructions,
  routine fixes). Ask first when a push or release could break a running
  deployment.
- Read prose end to end before the first commit. If a pushed commit needs
  fixing, amend or squash it while it is unreleased rather than stacking
  follow-up commits.

## Releases

Every commit that changes code gets a release; a docs-only change does not.
Follow `.agents/skills/cutting-a-release/SKILL.md`: signed annotated tag on
`origin/main`, wait for CI to pass first, then the release workflow publishes
`ghcr.io/greyrock-labs/unleashed-voucher-manager`.

## What docs, comments and commit messages may say

- Describe this repository only. No internal hostnames, IP addresses, SSIDs,
  usernames or 1Password item names, and no deployment details from other
  repositories. Use `example.com` and `192.0.2.x` in examples.
- No backstory: do not mention deleted repositories, abandoned approaches or
  earlier attempts. State the current behaviour and why.
- Grep the diff for internal details before the first push. Amending and
  force-pushing does not remove a leaked commit from the remotes.

## Remotes and tools

- `origin` is the Forgejo repository (see `git remote -v`), push-mirrored to
  GitHub (`greyrock-labs/unleashed-voucher-manager`).
- Use `tea` for Forgejo issues and pull requests; it is installed and
  authenticated. `gh` works for GitHub and GHCR (deleting package versions
  needs the `delete:packages` scope).
- Forgejo's web pages sit behind a bot check, so `curl` cannot read job logs;
  use the API (`/api/v1/repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/tasks`) for run status,
  and a browser for logs.

## Renovate

- Renovate names its branches `renovate-...`. Its npm updates change
  `frontend/package.json` without updating `package-lock.json`, so their CI
  fails on `npm ci`. Apply them on `main` with `npm install` so the lockfile
  is in the same commit, then close the pull request.
- Renovate only prunes branches with its configured prefix; it never removes
  `renovate/configure` after its onboarding pull request is closed by hand.
- The Renovate Dependency Dashboard issue is meant to stay open.
